# Analyzing-Business-Data-with-SQL

I will be practising the SQL skills learned in the previous notebooks and will try to approach SQL from a more business perspective in order to provide more data-driven actions.

TIPS to remember:

- Write your query in stages, and run it as you go to make sure at each stage it's producing the output you expect.
- If something isn't behaving as you expect, break parts of the query out into their own, separate queries to make sure there's not an inner logic error.
- Don't be afraid to write separate queries to check the underlying data, for instance you might write a query that you can use to manually check a calculation and give yourself confidence that the output you're seeing is correct.

The schema of the database is as following:
![Chinook_database_schema](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/191/chinook-schema.svg)

The schema above is of particular importance because I will refer back to it multiple times as I advance with my queries.

For each question in turn, I will provide a short explanation before writing the code and will summarize the results of the queries also.
